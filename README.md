  What is it?
  -----------

      The MOPPA is a project developed by two enthusiastic students
      of School of Engineering at Autonomous University of Barcelona.
      Originally developed as a student project for course Software
      Development and Quality, mentored by professor Rodolfo Quichon.


  How does it help to the society?
  -----------
  
      MOPPA's intention is to use distributed mobile processing power 
      in order to solve some of the world's most complex problems. MOPPA 
      allows our final users (scientists, engineers) to harness
      distributed mobile processing power, with the help of 
      benevolent people who provided their mobile power and electricity
      to the science community.
